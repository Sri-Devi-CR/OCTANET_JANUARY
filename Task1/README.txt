Task 1 in OctaNet Web Development Internship:

To design a landing page website.
To meet the task's problem statement, I initially researched about what are "landing pages" to grasp the requirement of the task and what is being expected from me.
After few hours of research, I decided to design an Event Landing Page that provides an description on an event scheduled by a Korean group of artists namely Monsta X. This website also allows ticket booking for the same event.
The website is made static for time being. In the near future, it would be converted to a dynamic website.

I do not own any pictures.
The necessary credits for the pictures would be reaching the owners.
